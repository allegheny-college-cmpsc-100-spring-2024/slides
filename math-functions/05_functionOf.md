# "A Function Of"

When one variable is **a funciton of** another variable, that means we use the first variable to calculate the second. 

<img src = "image.png" width = "550px" />

In this example, the size, color, and shape are all a function of the objects position in the list `i`. This is powerful because it allows one variable to affect many aspects of our canvas.

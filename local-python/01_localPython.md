# Local Python 

Running Python locally allows you to develop and test your code efficiently on your own machine.

Steps: 

1. **Install Python.** Download and install Python from the official website [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You may need to add Python to your system's PATH during installation.

2. **Write or copy a Python Script.** Save your Python in format `<filename>.py` (for example `main.py`).

3. **Run your script in Terminal**. Enter `python <filename>.py` (for example `python main.py`) in the Terminal and hit enter. Some systems will use `python3 <filename>.py` instead. 

Detailed steps will be provided in our next problem set, which will be run locally.

## Math Operations in Python

Python provides a variety of built-in mathematical operations that can be performed on numeric data types, such as integers and floating-point numbers. Some common math operations include:

### Addition
```python
result = 3 + 5  # Result will be 8
```

### Subtraction
```python
result = 10 - 3  # Result will be 7
```

### Multiplication
```python
result = 4 * 6  # Result will be 24
```

### Division
```python
result = 15 / 3  # Result will be 5.0 (float)
```

### Modulo (Remainder)
```python
result = 17 % 5  # Result will be 2
```

### Exponentiation
```python
result = 2 ** 3  # Result will be 8
```

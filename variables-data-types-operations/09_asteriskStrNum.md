## The same operator will sometimes produce different results with different data types

```python

# * with two integers
result = 3 * 4 # result will by 12

# * with integer and float
result = 3 * 4.0 # result will be 12.0

# * with integer and str
result  = "Hey" * 3 # result will be HeyHeyHey


```

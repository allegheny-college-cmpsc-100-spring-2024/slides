Create a remix of the trinket [linked](https://trinket.io/python/3eaeec768d) in the Discord channel and follow the instructions in the code comments! When you're finished, reply to the Discord thread with your remixed Trinket. Once you've submitted your Trinket, you'll select another student's link from the thread to read to your table.

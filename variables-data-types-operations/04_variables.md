# Variables

Variables are containers: they can hold a variety of different values. You could imagine a variable as a tea bag, and its value as the kind of tea the bag holds. You steep different teas the same way, but the flavor depens what's in the teabag. 

In Python, variables are assigned using the following syntax:

```
variable_name = variable_value
```

Even if you’ve never coded before, you might be familiar with the concept of a variable from taking algebra in school.

# Creating a Python Environment on Mac/Linux

1. In the repo, create a file called `requirements.txt`. This will list all the Python libaries you need in the environment.
2. Add any libaries you need to `requirements.txt` (e.g. vpython)
3. In terminal, type `echo "env">.gitignore`. This makes it so git ignores your environment and it doesn't take up unnecessary space on your remote repo.
4. To create the environment, enter `python3 -m venv env` in Terminal
5. To activate the environment, enter `source env/bin/activate`
6. To install dependencies, enter `pip install -r requirements.txt`
